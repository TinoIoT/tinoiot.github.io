Below is a list of commonly asked questions (along with answers) during the first meeting today. Feel free to DM us for more specific questions :)</p>\n<h2>How do we get components for projects?</h2>\n<p>Components, as of now, can’t be lended out by us because of restrictions on in-person meetings. In short, it would be fastest to purchase from an online store if you want to get started right away (we always provide links to recommended retailers). </p>\n<h2>How much would these components cost?</h2>\n<p>The good thing about IoT is that it has a very very low barrier to entry. It cost less than 50 dollars to build our prototype doorbell camera. The most expensive component—the microcontroller—can be reused endless times for other projects. After the initial purchase of a microcontroller + breadboard kit, a typical project would cost around 10 dollars. </p>\n<h2>Would I be able to publish my own projects on <a href=\"https://tinoiot.com\">tinoiot.com</a>?</h2>\n<p>Yes… eventually. We are currently in the process of setting up a submission form and all posts will have to follow strict guidelines (and have to go through the mandatory review process).</p>\n<h2>When are the meetings?</h2>\n<p>Our meetings will be at 12pm, on Wednesdays. Please make sure to use your school email when joining our Zoom call at <a href=\"https://meet.tinoiot.com\">meet.tinoiot.com</a></p>\n<h2>How do I become a member? Are there requirements?</h2>\n<p>TinoIoT does not have requirements nor fees, visit <a href=\"https://join.tinoiot.com\">join.tinoiot.com</a> to get started!</p>\n<h2>What if I can’t make the meetings on wednesday?</h2>\n<p>It would be best if you can make the bi-weekly meetings so you can ask questions and get more information / personalized help. However, we will be posting our slides on our website along with commentaries to help everyone stay on track with their projects. </p>\n<h2>Are the slides posted?</h2>\n<p>Of course! How could we not make another tiny link. Visit <a href=\"https://slides.tinoiot.com\">slides.tinoiot.com</a> to view ALL of our slides. They will be posted and updated to that site every meeting.</p>\n<h2>Do I have to follow the curriculum / projects?</h2>\n<p>Nope. You are always welcome to start your own projects and you could always message us for any help. Our officers have a wide range of capabilities, feel free to ask about anything!</p>\n<p>Make sure to <a href=\"https://join.tinoiot.com\">join.tinoiot.com</a> to get future announcements. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Common Questions","author":"Ethan Zhang","date":"September 24, 2020","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blogs/q-and-a/","pinned":true,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/about-us/","pinned":true,"source":"pinned"},"snippet":" The TinoIOT (Internet Of Things) Club’s primary objective revolves around the introduction and promotion of engineering and collaboration.
